   Culture Touch: the latest in culture as seen on ARTE in a digital weekly magazine. Every Friday, Culture Touch brings a selection of the most interesting exhibitions, shows, films, books, albums and events to keep you up to date with everything that's happening in the world of culture.

   Together with [Studio GOOD](http://www.studio-good.de) we concepted, designed and built a tablet magazine for ARTE to promote the great culture content available on ARTE. In addition to the app we also built a backend for letting the editors create the beautiful multimedia issues that make up Culture Touch.

   Enjoy!
