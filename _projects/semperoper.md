    Together with [Fons Hickmann M23](http://www.fonshickmann.com/) and [New Image](http://www.n-image.de/) we designed and built the iPhone app for one of Germany's most well known opera houses, the [Semperoper Dresden](http://www.semperoper.de/).
    
    We focused on making the app beautiful and useful to guests from Germany and abroad. Complete offline support means you can download the app in your hotel's WiFi and see the opera schedule on the road â€“ even without a German data plan. The app will also tell you if the show you are planing to go to is overlapping with one of your calendar events.
