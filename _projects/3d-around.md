    3DAround is food photography in 3D. It allows you to capture your food (or really almost any object) in 3D using only the camera of your iPhone.

    Together with the Swiss computer vision technology company [Dacuda](http://dacuda.com) we built an app making use of their advanced computer vision technology. Using 3DAround you can capture food or everyday objects and create a 3D model. This model can be uploaded and shared with your friends.

    The 3DAround app was built almost entirely in Apple's new programming language Swift using the latest iOS technologies available. It incorporates motion sensors and OpenGL.
