    On behalf of [SPORTFIVE](http://www.sportfive.de) we are building the app for the internationally renowned soccer club Borussia Dortmund. We took over the development of the app from our friends at [Rheinfabrik](http://www.rheinfabrik.de).

    The BVB app encompasses all the features a fan could wish for: match schedule, live ticker and push notifications, player and team information as well as posts from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. On a match day the app transforms into a realtime stream with detailed up to the minute infos, texts, videos and images. For this day, the user can choose between three different modes: in stadion, at home in front of the TV, or on the move. The updates are then tailored to each audience individually, considering their context and situation.

    The app is designed by our partners at [Silberpuls](http://silberpuls.de) and built with love for Android and iOS.
