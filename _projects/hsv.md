    We are building the app for the HSV on behalf of [SPORTFIVE](http://www.sportfive.de). In 2015 we took over the development of the app from our friends at [Rheinfabrik](http://www.rheinfabrik.de).
    The app features anything that a true HSV fan needs. There's news updates and information on the next games, detailed info about all players, social media integration and a digital version of the stadium magazine.
    On a match day, the app transforms into an emotional realtime stream with detailed up to the minute infos, texts, videos and images.
